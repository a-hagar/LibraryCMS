A library content management system built with ASP.NET. The CMS connects to a database with information such as:
   * Library Members and their contact information and preferred location
   * Books that are located in the library and the location
   * Library Locations across the Greater Toronto Area with a list of members registered and the books available at the location
   * Authorization for admins to edit, add, or delete any information for visitors to view
