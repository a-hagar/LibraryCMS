</p>

A library content management system built with ASP.NET. The CMS connects to a database with information such as:
   * Library Members and their contact information and preferred location
   * Books that are located in the library and the location
   * Library Locations across Ontario with a list of members registered and the books available at the location
   * Authorization for admins to edit, add, or delete any information for visitors to view

##Issues to Fix
- [x] Image upload
- [ ] Authentication for APIs

##Potential New Features
- [ ] Search Feature for Books & Locations
- [ ] Reservation system for users
- [ ] Expand database to include triggers & log tables to track user history
- [ ] Redesign (with or without Bootstrap)
